        <h3>The Challenges of Cross-Border Taxation and Accounting</h3>
        <p>Taxes are already a headache for most people, but managing tax obligations across two countries amplifies the complexity. U.S. citizens and businesses navigating financial life in Canada need to juggle differing tax laws, fluctuating exchange rates, and international regulations that can be difficult to untangle.</p>
